# Cyprus-City-Stats

Open Data visualisation built in Angular and D3.js.

## About

Cyprus City Stats is a stand-alone client application built in Angular and D3.js intended for exploring statistical data. The current implementation explores statistics about cities and villages in Cyprus. These can be grouped together via the graphical interface for aggregated results, hence deeper exploration and comparison.

The project is currently under development, needs a lot of code clean-up, but all in working condition. Clone the repo and place in your web server  and open index.html in any modern browser to fiddle with it. A dummy dataset is used for testing and demonstrating purposes. The final product will be released as a generic client-side application for exploring any type of statistical data.
